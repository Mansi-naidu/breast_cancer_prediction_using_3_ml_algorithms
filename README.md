This project is a breast cancer prediction that uses three machine learning algorithms to classify whether a breast tumor
is malignant or benign based on various features. 
The system aims to assist in early detection and diagnosis of breast cancer.
In this we comparing the performance of different algorithms, 
you can determine which one provides the highest accuracy and generalizes best to unseen data.
